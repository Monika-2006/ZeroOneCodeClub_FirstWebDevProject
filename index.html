<h1>KRISHNA : THE SUPREME GOD</h1>
<p><b>⦾ </b> KRISHNA,He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and
also as the Supreme God in his own right. He is the god of protection,
compassion, tenderness, and love; and is one of the most popular and widely
revered among Hindu divinities. Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by
Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which
falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.The
anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna
Līlā. He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the
Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu
philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in
various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine
hero, and the universal supreme being.[20] His iconography reflects these
legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant
eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or
surrounded by female devotees; or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to
Arjuna.</p>

<h3><b>⦾ </b> Influence : </h3>
<p>The worship of Krishna is part of Vaishnavism, a major tradition within
Hinduism. Krishna is considered a full avatar of Vishnu, or one with Vishnu
himself.[177] However, the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is
complex and diverse,[178] with Krishna of Krishnaite sampradayas considered an
independent deity and supreme.[23][179] Vaishnavas accept many incarnations of
Vishnu, but Krishna is particularly important. Their theologies are generally
centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms
Krishnaism and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the
former implying that Krishna is the transcendent Supreme Being. [180] Some
scholars, as Friedhelm Hardy, do not define Krishnaism as a sub-order or
offshoot of Vaishnavism, considering it a parallel and no less ancient current
of Hinduism.[23] All Vaishnava traditions recognise Krishna as the eighth
avatar of Vishnu; others identify Krishna with Vishnu, while Krishnaite
traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism,[181][182] Ekasarana Dharma, Mahanam
Sampraday, Nimbarka Sampradaya and the Vallabha Sampradaya regard Krishna as
the Svayam Bhagavan, the original form of Lord or the same as the concept of
Brahman in Hinduism.[5][183][184][185][186] Gitagovinda of Jayadeva considers
Krishna to be the supreme lord while the ten incarnations are his forms.
Swaminarayan, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, also worshipped
Krishna as God himself. "Greater Krishnaism" corresponds to the second and
dominant phase of Vaishnavism, revolving around the cults of the Vasudeva,
Krishna, and Gopala of the late Vedic period.[187] Today the faith has a
significant following outside of India as well.[188]</p>
